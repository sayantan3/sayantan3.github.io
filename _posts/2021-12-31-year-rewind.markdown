This a simple post upon reflection of year and what I learn and what should I do for progress 

1. The problem of life should be tackled as fast and as soon as possible.
2. Focus should be on the center of the problem not in periphery.
3. Calculated hard work.
4. No time for overthinking; oftentime this mislead the target/goal in its entirety - in exchange taking action can shape good thiking.
5. Quality and depth over everything.
6. Touch as many subject and topic as possible - read a lot.
7. Seeking comfort is dangerous.
8. Focusing on the basic foundation in particular subject.
9. Challenging daily, pushing boundary - making things and operating in a uncertain place can lead to life long experiance.
10. Creating things > Consuming things.
11. Good social skill confers life-long benefits. Getting good at making good first impression, being funny, speaking publicly.
12. To the extenet enjoy everything - even the tedious hard working problems.

Just be consistant with things and thinking over right things and ticking right boxes right time only chance that lead to success.
Wish 2022 is will be the best year.
Hurry up! No time to sit idly. Let make great things.
